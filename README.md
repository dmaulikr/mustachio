This app is a play off of the SeeFood app that tells you whether or not what you are taking a picture of is a hot dog or not. 

I used the neural network of IBM’s Watson/Bluemix to bring the power of it’s visual recognition to an app. After initial setup I saw that is was pulling up the word ‘mustachio’ each time I took a picture of someone with a mustache. So the next logical step after that was of course to make an app that told you whether or not you needed more Mustache.
